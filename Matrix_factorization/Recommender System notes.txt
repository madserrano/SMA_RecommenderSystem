Recommender System notes:

Mean was calculated and substracted from original values to normalize the matrix or to remove the skewness.

two method to calculate mean were tried, one with only rated movies skipping nan values, other with 0 in place of nan values. Both resulted in nealry same RMSE value.

SVDS was used to leverage parallel multi core use.

Both normalized and skewed data gave approx same rsme values.

Generated ratings for empty data contains negative values.

As number of latent feature increses , error decreases

Only RMSE error for item originally rated by user was calculated.
